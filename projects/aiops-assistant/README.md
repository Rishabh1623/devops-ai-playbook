# AIOps Assistant — Kira

An AI-powered SRE assistant built on Claude (Amazon Bedrock). Kira diagnoses production incidents by querying CloudWatch Logs, Prometheus metrics, and EKS cluster health — then responds with root cause, evidence, and fix recommendations.

## Architecture

```
Streamlit UI (app.py)
      │
      ▼
Kira agent loop (agent.py) ──► Claude on Bedrock (Converse API, tool use)
      │  runs each tool Claude asks for
      ├── fetch_logs           → Lambda → CloudWatch Logs
      ├── fetch_metrics        → in-process → Prometheus (ClusterIP, private)
      └── fetch_service_health → in-process → EKS API + Prometheus (ClusterIP, private)
```

> **Why do two tools run in-process?** Prometheus has no authentication, so it is only reachable inside the cluster (ClusterIP). Kira itself runs in EKS, so `agent.py` loads `lambda/fetch_metrics` and `lambda/fetch_health` directly and calls them at `http://kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus.monitoring.svc:9090`. Nothing about Prometheus is exposed to the internet.

> **Why not a Bedrock Agent?** Bedrock Agents (classic) is in maintenance mode and new agent creation is blocked on accounts without prior usage. Kira now runs its own agent loop in `agent.py`: it sends the question and the 3 tool definitions (built from `schemas/*.json`) to Claude, runs the matching tool whenever Claude requests one, and feeds the result back until Claude answers. The tools receive the same event format a Bedrock Agent would send, so their code is unchanged.

---

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with access to a Claude model on Bedrock (default: `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6`)
- EKS cluster running with `kube-prometheus-stack` (Prometheus stays ClusterIP)
- AWS CLI configured (`aws configure`)
- Python 3.10+

---

## Step 1: Set Up IAM Roles

Run the provided script to create the Lambda execution role:

```bash
chmod +x setup-iam.sh
./setup-iam.sh
```

This creates:

| Role | Used By | Permissions |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `aiops-lambda-role` | The `aiops-fetch-logs` Lambda | CloudWatch Logs read, EKS describe, Lambda basic execution |

The AWS identity that runs `app.py` separately needs `bedrock:InvokeModel` on the Claude inference profile, `lambda:InvokeFunction` on `aiops-fetch-logs`, and `eks:DescribeCluster`, `eks:ListNodegroups`, `eks:DescribeNodegroup` (for `fetch_service_health`). On EKS this is the Terraform-managed Pod Identity role `eks-cluster-aiops-assistant`.

---

## Step 2: Create the fetch_logs Lambda

Create the `aiops-fetch-logs` Lambda in the AWS Console (or via CLI) with the code in `lambda/fetch_logs/lambda_function.py` and the `aiops-lambda-role` execution role.

Runtime: **Python 3.12** | Timeout: **30 seconds**

`fetch_metrics` and `fetch_health` are not Lambdas: they ship inside the Kira image and run in its pod. If you created `aiops-fetch-metrics` and `aiops-fetch-health` before, you can delete them.

---

## Step 3: Prometheus URL

The in-process tools read Prometheus's address from `PROMETHEUS_URL`. The default, `http://kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus.monitoring.svc:9090`, works inside the cluster and is also set in `gitops/k8s/aiops-assistant/deployment.yml`.

When running Kira on your machine, port-forward Prometheus and point Kira at it:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring svc/kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus 9090:9090
export PROMETHEUS_URL=http://localhost:9090
```

Don't expose Prometheus with a LoadBalancer: it has no authentication.

---

## Step 4: Configure the Lambdas

Run the deploy script. It verifies the `aiops-fetch-logs` Lambda exists and sets its timeout to 30s:

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

---

## Step 5: (Optional) Generate Sample Data

Populate CloudWatch Logs with realistic error scenarios to test Kira:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_sample_data.py --region us-east-1
```

This writes 100 realistic log events (503 errors, OOM kills, connection pool exhaustion, etc.) to `/app/production`.

---

## Step 6: Run the Streamlit UI

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` if you need to change anything (all values are optional):

```env
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
BEDROCK_MODEL_ID=us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6

# Optional — omit to use your AWS CLI profile / SSO / IAM role:
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY>
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>
# AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=<YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>
```

Install dependencies and start the UI:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv && . venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Open **http://localhost:8501** in your browser.

## Guardrails

Kira's safety and cost limits live in `guardrails.py`:

| Guardrail | What it does | Setting (default) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Untrusted tool output | Every tool result is wrapped as `{"untrusted_tool_output": ...}`, and the system prompt tells Claude never to follow instructions inside it. Log lines can be written by any pod, so this defends against prompt injection. | — |
| Token budget | Input + output tokens are counted from each Converse `usage`. Once a question reaches the budget, Kira stops with a message. | `KIRA_MAX_TOKENS_PER_QUESTION` (`100000`) |
| Rate limit | Questions per browser session in a sliding window. "New Session" does not reset it. | `KIRA_MAX_QUESTIONS_PER_WINDOW` (`10`) per `KIRA_RATE_WINDOW_SECONDS` (`300`) |
| Action allowlist | `check_action()` allows only scale / restart / roll back of deployments in `boutique`, with 1–5 replicas. Any write tool must call it in code. | edit `guardrails.py` |

The prompt instruction reduces prompt-injection risk but cannot remove it, which is why write actions are checked in code.

Run the tests (the live prompt-injection test calls Claude on Bedrock and is opt-in):

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
KIRA_LIVE_TESTS=1 python -m unittest discover tests
```

## Sample Questions to Ask Kira

- Why are we seeing 503 errors in the last hour?
- Is CPU usage high across the boutique services?
- Check database connections and latency
- Are all pods healthy? Any restarts?
- What are the most frequent errors in the last 2 hours?

## Potential Issues

### Claude model not available
If Kira replies with `AccessDeniedException ... is not available for this account`, your account can't use that model even if it appears in `aws bedrock list-foundation-models`. Test a model directly and set a working one as `BEDROCK_MODEL_ID` in `.env`:

```bash
aws bedrock-runtime converse --region us-east-1 \
  --model-id us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6 \
  --messages '[{"role":"user","content":[{"text":"hi"}]}]' \
  --inference-config '{"maxTokens":10}'
```

### fetch_metrics / fetch_health can't reach Prometheus
These tools run in the Kira process and call `PROMETHEUS_URL`. In the cluster, check the service exists: `kubectl get svc kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus -n monitoring`. When running Kira locally, the in-cluster address doesn't resolve: start the `kubectl port-forward` from Step 3 and set `PROMETHEUS_URL=http://localhost:9090`.

### fetch_logs returns no results
The default log group is `/eks/boutique/pods`. This group is only created after Fluent Bit starts shipping logs. Make sure `aws-for-fluent-bit` is running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n amazon-cloudwatch
```

If the log group doesn't exist yet, run the sample data generator first (Step 5) which creates `/app/production`.

### fetch_health uses wrong cluster name
The tool defaults to cluster name `eks-cluster`. If your cluster has a different name, update `DEFAULT_CLUSTER` in `lambda/fetch_health/lambda_function.py` and rebuild the Kira image.

### fetch_health access denied on eks:DescribeCluster
`fetch_health` runs with Kira's own credentials. On EKS, check the Pod Identity role has the `ReadClusterHealth` statements (`terraform apply` in `projects/Infrastructure`):

```bash
aws iam get-role-policy \
  --role-name eks-cluster-aiops-assistant \
  --policy-name bedrock-and-tools
```

Locally, your CLI identity needs the same EKS read permissions.

### AWS credentials not resolving in Streamlit
If `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are left blank in `.env`, boto3 falls back to the default credential chain (`~/.aws/credentials`, environment variables, IAM role). If none of those are configured, Bedrock calls will fail with an auth error. Either fill in the credentials in `.env` or ensure your terminal session has valid AWS credentials before starting Streamlit.
